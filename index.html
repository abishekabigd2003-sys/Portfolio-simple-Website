            <h2 class="section-two__title">About Me</h2>
            <p class="section-two__desc">Hi, Im a UI/UX designer and full-stack developer with a passion for creating
                beautiful, user-centered
                digital
                experiences that are also technically sound and scalable. With a unique blend of creative design skills
                and
                solid coding expertise, I specialize in bridging the gap between aesthetics and functionality. I dont
                just
                design interfacesâ€”I design experiences that solve real problems and make technology more accessible and
                intuitive.

                My front-end stack includes tools like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Tailwind CSS, while on the back
                end, I
                work with Node.js, Express, and databases like MongoDB and PostgreSQL. I also enjoy working with modern
                frameworks and platforms like Next.js, Firebase, and Docker, allowing me to build high-performing,
                responsive
                web apps from start to finish.

                On the UI/UX side, Im skilled in Figma, Adobe XD, and prototyping tools that help translate ideas into
                interactive visuals. I approach every project with a strong focus on usability, accessibility, and
                responsiveness, ensuring a smooth experience across all devices and platforms. Whether Im conducting
                user
                research, creating wireframes, or implementing REST APIs, I always aim to deliver thoughtful,
                well-crafted
                solutions.

                I love working on projects that challenge me to grow, both creatively and technically. Whether its a
                sleek
                landing page, a SaaS dashboard, or a full-scale web application, I take pride in every line of code and
                every
                pixel on the screen. I believe in continuous learning, collaboration, and building products that make a
                difference.

                Lets connect and create something amazing.</p>
